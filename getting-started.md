# Getting started

## Overview

ZenChain is a powerful blockchain that is EVM compatible with sharding and staking features. For details about ZenChain you can read more [here](https://docs.zenchain.co). Developing on ZenChain should feel very familiar for Ethereum developers, as we inherit almost all the tools and techniques like truffle, hardhat, solidity, remix, wallets, etc.

The simplest way to interact with Zen blockchain is via JSON RPCs.

#### Querying Harmony blockchain using JSON RPCs

* About [RPCs](api.md)
* Simple `curl` command examples provided

#### Creating a wallet 

* Using browser extensions. Any other [wallets](network/holders/browser-extension-wallets/) can also be used.
* ZenChain [CLI](network/holders/zenchain-cli/), also provides a quick way to create/manage wallet, interact with blockchain, etc.

#### Multiple development environments: Mainnet, Testnet, Localnet

* Several development environments exists
* Multiple faucets to receive testnet funds
* Blockchain explorers
