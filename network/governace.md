# Governace

### Network Governance

As a first step, we are releasing the network governance app, which enables the active validators to create proposals and vote on them, for the benefit of the network. As the network and core protocol are quite complicated and require deep knowledge of PoS and some technical/blockchain background, we are only letting everyone create and vote on the proposals.

The network governance model includes a proposal, voting, and implementation processes. A proposal has to be submitted by users. 

A proposal will be moved forward when the majority is reached. Otherwise, it is rejected. The majority of the quorum is defined as more than 66% of all the staked tokens.

The detailed plan will be announced later.
