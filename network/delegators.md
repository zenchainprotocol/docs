# Delegators

For those wishing to participate in staking without running a validator, delegation is the best approach to still get involved and earn block rewards. ZenChain holders can delegate their tokens to existing validators using our staking explorer or ZenChaind. If the tokens are delegated to an elected validator, a portion of the block reward earned by the validator will be credited to the delegator.

The earned block rewards are stored in a separate reward balance of the delegator, which can be immediately withdrawn to the delegator’s account balance. The block rewards can also be staked again to achieve the compounding effect of staking.

Your delegated tokens are also associated with slashing risks of the validator. As a delegator, you should carefully choose validators based on their historical performance metrics such as APR, uptime and commission. In case of indifference or indecisiveness, you should distribute your delegations among multiple validators in order to minimize risk.

### **Delegation**

Any ZenChain user can delegate their tokens to any number of validators on the network. Delegating to a validator entitles the user to a share of that validator’s block rewards based on the commission rate \(see below\) set by the validator. Delegating to a validator does not give that validator direct control over the delegator’s funds. However, the delegator does assume the risk of being slashed \(see below\) if the validator misbehaves. ****

When performing a delegation, we recommend you do due diligence on the following:

1. Ensure the node validator you are delegating to is one that you trust and have faith to not get slashed. Remember, if you delegate to them and they get slashed, then your delegation will also get slashed.
2. Check these 3 rates of the node validator: 
   1. Commission Rate - This represents the percentage of delegator’s rewards retained by the validator in exchange for providing access to ZenChain staking system. For example, if this rate is set to 25%, then you as the delegator will get 75% of the reward while the node validator will get 25%.
   2. Maximum Commission Rate - The node validator can change their commission rate at any time and that change will be represented in 24 hours. The maximum amount they can set their commission rate to is indicated here. For example, if the node validator's maximum rate is set to 100%, then they are able to change their commission rate to 100% at any time.
   3. Maximum Commission Rate Change - This is the maximum daily increase possible. For example, if this is set to 5% then the most a node validator can change their rate by in a single 24 hour period is 5%.
3. The top 100 node validator list and their staked/delegated amounts. It's important to do this because you want the node you are delegating to, to be a part of the network to ensure you are also earning rewards.
4. We recommend that you continuously monitor your delegation and the node validators that you have delegated to.
