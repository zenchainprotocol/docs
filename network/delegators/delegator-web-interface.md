# Delegator web interface

Here is the Staking Explorer link:  [https://staking.zenchain.co](https://staking.zenchain.co)

The Staking Explorer is an easy way to stake, delegate, send funds and view all information of ZenChain validators.

You can explore the dashboard without using your ONE address, but the ONE address you use will be used for any transactions. 

You can login to an account using the Kelpr Chrome Extension

After logging in, you can view network analytics, a list of validators, validator profiles, and other information to help you decide who to delegate to.

Every transaction or delegation must be signed.
