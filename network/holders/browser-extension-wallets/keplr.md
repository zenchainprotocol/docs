#### Why do I have to give Keplr permission to 'access data on all websites?

This extension injects scripts and helper functions for every web page to allow the extension and websites utilizing CosmosJS to communicate. A transaction requested from a web page is only processed when the user explicitly signs the transaction via a popup window. Thus, it can be guaranteed that there are no security risks with this extension regarding vast permission requests.

Keplr never collects, logs and/or stores your personal data. For those skeptical, you can always review the source code for this extension on our GitHub repository: github.com/chainapsis/keplr-extension.
